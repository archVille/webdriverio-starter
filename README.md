# Project

This is a simple test project for a webdriverio boilerplate

## Run

Simply run
```bash
npx wdio wdio.conf.js
```

## Notes

At the moment there are 2 .js files
- basic.js
- example.e2e.js

example.e2e.js uses the page object pattern. This one has  been commented out for further work, with its files for the page objects inside the folder
